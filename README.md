# mdbook-cs
> WIP

Preprocessor for [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) that adds features to make note taking for CS students easier.

Currently only supports rendering latex and embeding the result onto the page, useful for drawing figures.

Example book in `/example`, and compiled version [here](https://jbakken.com/mdbook-cs/).
